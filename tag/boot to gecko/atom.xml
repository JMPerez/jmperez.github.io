But mobile web development is still a step behind, and we need browsers that can easily be updated without needing to make a whole OS update, and these browsers should strive for bringing to mobile devices features like access to its hardware (see <a href="http://johnhammink.blogspot.com/2011/11/lets-have-look-at-some-recently-landed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Device API</a>) and better usage of the hardware on which they are running.</p><p>Why Windows Phone doesn’t support file upload? Why PS Vita doesn’t support audio, video, WebGL or localStorage? From a developer’s point of view it is a pity that we can’t use a web stack for granted, having to deal meanwhile with polyfills. This makes it slower to embrace new features, and makes the large mobile devices eco-system even more complex.</p><p>I really welcome initiatives like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/b2g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boot to Gecko</a>, that show off how incredibly powerful the web can be, and make web development a first citizen on mobile environment.</p>]]></content>
